# Nand2Tetris Course Solutions 🖥️

This repository contains my solutions and files for the **Nand2Tetris** course, a project-based course that takes you through building a computer system from scratch. You will design basic logic gates (using NAND gates) and build a complete software stack, including an operating system and programming language. 💻

## Overview 🔍

The **Nand2Tetris** course is designed to provide a hands-on understanding of computer architecture and software development, guiding you through each phase of creating a working computer system. 🏗️

## Project List 📂

The Nand2Tetris course is divided into the following projects:

1. **Project 1: Boolean Logic** - Implement basic logic gates using NAND gates. 🔲
2. **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic** - Build half-adders, full-adders, and other arithmetic logic units. ➕➖
3. **Project 3: Sequential Logic** - Construct flip-flops and registers, enabling the creation of sequential circuits. 🔄
4. **Project 4: Machine Language** - Develop an assembly language and an assembler for a simple computer. 🖥️
5. **Project 5: Computer Architecture** - Build a computer's CPU, memory, and I/O modules. ⚙️
6. **Project 6: Assembler** - Create an assembler that translates symbolic machine code into binary code. 📝
7. **Project 7: Virtual Machine I** - Develop a virtual machine (VM) and a stack-based programming language. 💾
8. **Project 8: Virtual Machine II** - Enhance the VM to support more advanced features. 🔧
9. **Project 9: High-Level Language** - Design a high-level, object-oriented programming language (Jack). 🖋️
10. **Project 10: Compiler I** - Create a Jack-to-VM translator (the first half of the compiler). 🧑‍💻
11. **Project 11: Compiler II** - Complete the compiler by implementing the code generation phase. ⚡
12. **Project 12: Operating System** - Build a simple operating system for the Hack platform. 🖥️💻
13. **Project 13: Final Project** - Combine everything learned to create your own software project. 🎯

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with these projects, clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avishek8136/nand2tetris-projects.git
```

### Dependencies 🔧

- **Java**: Required for running some of the tools and simulators. ☕
- **Python**: Required for various VM and assembler projects. 🐍
- **Bash (or Command Prompt)**: To run the shell scripts or batch files. 💻

### How to Run ▶️

Each project folder contains the necessary files (e.g., `.hdl`, `.asm`, `.tst`, and source code files). Follow the instructions provided in the individual project folders for compiling and testing.
