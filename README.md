# Nand2Tetris Projects

This repository contains my solutions and files for the Nand2Tetris course. Nand2Tetris is a unique project-based course that takes you through the process of building a computer system, from designing basic logic gates (NAND gates) to creating a complete software stack, including an operating system and programming language.

## Course Overview

The Nand2Tetris course is divided into several projects, each building upon the previous one. Here's a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

1. **Project 1: Boolean Logic** - Implement basic logic gates using NAND gates.
2. **Project 2: Boolean Arithmetic** - Build half-adders, full-adders, and other arithmetic logic units.
3. **Project 3: Sequential Logic** - Construct flip-flops and registers, enabling the creation of sequential circuits.
4. **Project 4: Machine Language** - Develop an assembly language and an assembler for a simple computer.
5. **Project 5: Computer Architecture** - Build a computer's CPU, memory, and I/O modules.
6. **Project 6: Assembler** - Create an assembler that translates symbolic machine code into binary code.
7. **Project 7: Virtual Machine I** - Develop a virtual machine (VM) and a stack-based programming language.
8. **Project 8: Virtual Machine II** - Enhance the VM to support more advanced features.
9. **Project 9: High-Level Language** - Design a high-level, object-oriented programming language (Jack).
10. **Project 10: Compiler I** - Create a Jack-to-VM translator (the first half of the compiler).
11. **Project 11: Compiler II** - Complete the compiler by implementing the code generation phase.
12. **Project 12: Operating System** - Build a simple operating system for the Hack platform.
13. **Project 13: Final Project** - Combine everything learned to create your own software project.
